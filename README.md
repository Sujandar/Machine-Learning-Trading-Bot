# Machine-Learning-Trading-Bot

# Overview of the project and project goals

In a Jupyter notebook I Implemented an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions, Adjusted the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm, Trained a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model, Created an Evaluation Report

To complete the task the following steps were perfomed:

Establish a Baseline Performance

Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
